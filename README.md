<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Currently, there are a lot of different sources of information for NUS students about campus life, be it emails about school activities or academic platforms such as NusMods. However, it is tiring to keep track of all the information from all those different sources and sometimes students may forget about certain key information.

Instead of letting students gather information about their module information and various school activities bit by bit, OmniCampus provides a collective information hub for students and staff to interact and post things about campus life on a social media app?
Posts may be realated to sections such as module information and campus activity promotions. All users of the app can make a post or access their desired information.

Additionally, this app is made more relevant to NUS student community by having features to boost productivity such as to-do-list and pomodoro technique. 

Furthermore, OmniCampus offers easy access to NUS resources by providing a resource compilation page. This allows a centralised system to quickly navigate to different school resources.
